Description: This project includes modules for docking prepare, post-processing,
        MD simulation prepare and post-processing.
        
        The original idea of the project is to combine machine learning with
        docking to lower down the false positive rate.

            From the results of md simulation or the results of molecular docking,
            we first extract the important features for ML.
        
            Features including, contacts, vdw energy contribution, electrostatic
            contributions. All the features are decomposed into single residues,
            where backbone and sidechain interactions are separated.
        
            After which, the features are selected based on the distribution,
            the difference between plus and minus groups. Only limited number of
            features are chosen for ML training.
        
            Step 1. From coordination files to obtain features.
                We prepare a input file, called "input.dat". The file contains two columns. First
                column is the filename of a complex file (receptor + ligand) in pdb file format.
                Second column is the ligand code, or residue name of the ligand involving the
                interactions.
